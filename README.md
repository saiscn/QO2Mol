This repository contains the scripts for accessing QO2Mol dataset, the large-scale quantum chemistry dataset with 20 million conformers, designed for the research in molecular sciences under an open-source license.

# Download Files

Data files can be accessed at: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-4FrnNrVBlL2RaBuXpalgNCk1q79VHtc?usp=drive_link)

Steps:
- git clone this repo.
- download and put all `*.pkl` files under `./download/raw/` directory.


# Environment Preparation

>pip install -f requirements.txt

Note that `torch_geometric` may need to be installed separately follow the instruction on [PyG Documentation](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Dataset Preprocess

Make sure current work directory is under the repository root
>pwd

Then run the data processing script. This should take a relatively long time (depending on Machine hardware specifications).
> sh process_data.sh

# Usage demo

We provide a usage demo that simply requires running the script
>sh scripts\dimenetpp\qm_benchmark\tr_baseline_e.sh
